# Backend series Learning With Chai and Code
I learned about complex backend projects built with Node.js, Express.js, mongodb, mongoose, JWT, bcrypt, and many more. This project is a complete backend project that has all the features that a backend project should have.  Building a complete video hosting website similar to YouTube with all the features like login, signup, upload video, like, dislike, comment, reply, subscribe, unsubscribe, and many more.
The project uses all standard practices like JWT, bcrypt, access tokens, refresh Tokens, and many more. Learned a lot new things in building this project.
